LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private int x1 - This variable represents the x-coordinate from the 1st input
private int x2 - This variable represents the x-coordinate from the 2nd input
private int y1 - This variable represents the y-coordinate from the 1st input
private int y2 - This variable represents the y-coordinate from the 2nd input


Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)
This constructor contains the points of both coordinates which will later be manipulated to form equations


Methods
Public double findSlope(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4)
This method runs the slope finding equation with (num4-num3)/(num2-num1) and returns slope

Public double yIntercept(int x1, int y1, double slope)
this method runs the equation to find the y intercept by (y1/slope) - x1 that returns a yIntercept value

Public double calculateDistance(int num1, int num2, int num3, int num4)
This method will calculate distance

Public double userEquation()
this method takes the user input and applies it to an equation to calculate an output which will then be returned in coordinate format

Math.round()
rounds the numbers

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this
instance including:
- X and Y coordinate information
- Slope Intercept Form equation


EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
step 3: Attach coordinates to a new object
Step 4: print the first coordinate point
step 5: print the 2nd coordinate point
step 6: print the slope
step 7: print the y intercept
step 8: print the slope intercept form equation
step 9: print the distance between the 2 points
step 10: ask user to enter an x value
step 11: return a coordinate point that uses that x and has a y value from the equation
